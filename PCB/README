1.0 Files
	IOlinesManagement  The interface between microcontroller and the (I/O) HILO's pins

2.0 Decription
	All files related to the PCB are stored in this folder.
	In order to allow future HILO's hardware update, the interfaces and the HILO's brain has been developed separately, in
	two independent PCBs.

3.0 Versioning considerations
	3.1 pullup-outputs branch
		In this branch, the output pins interfaces have been developed with a classic pull-up scheme. It requires much less
		components then other solutions, but it waste (<V>/10K)<n-pins> amperes, and provide low output current <V>/10K
