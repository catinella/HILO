2.0 Decription
	The goal of this progect is to get a device that allows you to test an electronic system in easy way, by remote too.
	In the 1990 when I was studing at high-scool, who was designed new devices, used generic box with buttons, switches,
	leds, displays.... and so on, to emulate the external environment. Today, unfortunately, many Italian companies still use
	the same deplorable methodology! Due to this approach firmware developers cannot work from their home.

	But the smarter companies use advanced and complicated devices that allow them to test their electronic products remotely,
	in deeper and easier way. These tools are very sophisticated and programmable simulator, where they can simulate the
	external environment is realistic and releiable way. These tools class is calle HILO.

	This project want to provide an economic and very very simple HILO.
