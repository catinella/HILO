1.0 Files
	HILO_engine      The real-time component that performs the scheduled test
	HILO_interface   The component that interface the HILO's engine with the test client system

2.0 Description
	This folder contains the firmware needed by the all HILO's components
	
	Dataflow description:
	=====================
	Please, consider the logic scheme stored in the ../PCB/README file.
	As you can read in the main README file, this HILO provides two different functional modes: in the first the user can 
	change the output channels values and check for the input channel status, dinamically; in the second the user can
	compose a test-recepit that contains all test steps to follow and sends it to the HILO using the the wireless connection.
	In this second mode the ESP32 checks for the authorization's request and, if it has success then it will drive the engine
	to perform the configured test.

	
	When the RealTime driver (STM32) get the test-procedure start message, it starts to execute the following steps in loop,
	until the test has terminated
		1) it reads the test's step
		2) it sets the output pin and reads the input ones
		3) it sends the test-step log to the HILO's interface manager (ESP32)
		4) if the step was the last one it sends also a test-end message to the interface manager
		5) if it receive a test-stop message from the interface then the test will be stopped (no other steps)
		6) if a (configured) critical error has been detected then a test-end message will be returned to the interface
