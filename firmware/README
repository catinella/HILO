	HILO_engine      The real-time component that performs the scheduled test
	HILO_interface   The component that interface the HILO's engine with the test client system

2.0 Description
	This folder contains the firmware needed by the all HILO's components
	
	Dataflow description:
	=====================
	Please, consider the logic scheme stored in the ../PCB/README file.
	The HILO can function in two different ways: scheduled-mode and realtime-mode.

	In the first one, the user have to prepare a test's recipit and send it via REST API to the HILO_interface component.
	Then it will instructs the HILO_engine on the step iw will have to follow to perform the test correctly. At the end of
	the test, the software-client will retrive all resulted data via REST API, and the user will be able to evaluate
	the the DUT behaviohr.
	
	In the realtime-mode, the user can change the output-pins value via REST API, dinamically. All data on the monitored
	input pins will be continuously reported via UDP stream. So, the user will be able to evaluate the DUT behavior
	modifying the DUT's input and checking for the DUT's output, dinamically.
